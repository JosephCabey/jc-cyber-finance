# 🕵️ What You Need to Know: Pegasus Spyware

**Pegasus** is a military-grade spyware developed by the Israeli cyber-intelligence company **NSO Group**. It has been used to covertly infiltrate smartphones—stealing data, monitoring activity, and turning devices into surveillance tools.

## 🔓 What Can Pegasus Do?

Once installed, Pegasus can:
- Read texts, emails, and encrypted messages (e.g., WhatsApp, Signal)
- Access photos, call logs, contacts, and location data
- Activate the microphone and camera silently
- Monitor app activity and steal sensitive files

---

## 🧠 How Pegasus Infects Devices

Pegasus can enter your phone using:
- **Zero-click exploits** – no interaction needed (e.g., iMessage exploit)
- **One-click links** – user taps a malicious URL
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities** – unknown security flaws in apps or OS

These advanced tactics allow Pegasus to bypass even secure platforms like iOS and Android.

## 🎯 Who Has Been Targeted?

Although NSO Group claims it's used to fight terrorism, Pegasus has been linked to surveillance of:
- Investigative journalists
- Human rights advocates
- Political opposition figures
- Heads of state (e.g., French President Emmanuel Macron)

The 2021 **Pegasus Project** uncovered over 50,000 phone numbers suspected to be surveillance targets.

## 🛡️ How to Protect Yourself

While most people won’t be targeted, here are practical defenses:
- **Keep your phone updated** with the latest security patches
- **Avoid suspicious links**, even from trusted contacts
- **Use encrypted messaging apps** like Signal
- **Restart your phone daily** to disrupt in-memory infections
- **Use a secure phone** (e.g., iOS with Lockdown Mode, or hardened Android like GrapheneOS)

## 🧪 Tools for Detection

If you believe you're at risk:
- Use [**MVT (Mobile Verification Toolkit)**](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt) to check for Pegasus traces
- Look for signs like battery drain, camera activity, or data spikes

> Amnesty International developed forensic methods to detect Pegasus on iPhones via backup logs.
