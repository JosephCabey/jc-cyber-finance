# Security Playground

Welcome to the **Security Playground**, a dedicated space where I experiment with cybersecurity concepts, tools, and scripts in a hands-on environment.

This folder is part of my larger `jc-cyber-finance` repository and represents the practical side of my learning. Here, I break down complex topics into small, testable projects that highlight essential skills for modern security analysts.

## 🔧 Contents Coming Soon
- Python scripts for log analysis and threat detection
- Mock data for simulating brute force and phishing scenarios
- Practice with Linux commands and system hardening tasks
- Case studies and notes from cybersecurity labs and courses

## 🎯 Goal
To develop and demonstrate real-world cybersecurity techniques in a safe, educational environment — especially those applicable to financial services, insurance, and SOC operations.

Stay tuned for updates and contributions as I grow this collection!
