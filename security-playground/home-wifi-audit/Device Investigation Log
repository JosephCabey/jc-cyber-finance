# 📓 Device Investigation Log

A running log to track unidentified, suspicious, or unfamiliar devices detected on your home Wi-Fi network. Useful for auditing, confirming legitimate devices, and identifying potential intrusions.

## ❓ FAQ: Why Does One Device Show Up with Multiple MAC Addresses?

### 💬 Can the same device appear twice on my network?
Yes. It’s completely normal for a single device (like a laptop) to appear multiple times with different MAC addresses. This happens when the device has **multiple network interfaces** or uses **MAC randomization**.

---

### 🔄 What causes this behavior?
Here are the most common reasons:

| Reason                       | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multiple adapters**        | Devices have separate MACs for Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and virtual interfaces     |
| **VPN usage**               | VPN clients often create virtual adapters with unique MACs                 |
| **MAC randomization**       | OS features (like in Windows 10/11, iOS, Android) that rotate MACs by network |
| **Enterprise configuration** | Company laptops may mask hostnames or rotate MACs for security            |

### 🧠 Example: Morgan Stanley Work Laptop
If you used a company-issued Lenovo ThinkPad connected to your home network:
- It might appear as `E-LPWPF3W5NX9` under one MAC
- And `E-LPWPF3TZ5WG` under another, when connected via VPN or Ethernet

Both entries are tied to the **same physical device**, but your router sees them as separate because of interface-level differences.

---

### ✅ What should I do when I see this?
- **Look up the MAC address** using a tool like [https://macvendors.com](https://macvendors.com)
- If both belong to the same vendor (e.g., Intel or Lenovo), and match your usage patterns, log them under the same device in your investigation log
- Rename them for clarity, like:
  - `Lenovo Wi-Fi Adapter`
  - `Lenovo VPN Adapter`
- You can also **pause/block** one to see if it impacts a known device

> Keeping this log organized with context makes your Wi-Fi audits more secure, less confusing, and easier to revisit in the future.
