# üõ°Ô∏è Home Wi-Fi Security Audit

This project simulates a basic home Wi-Fi network security audit using open-source tools and security analyst methodology. It aims to identify common vulnerabilities in a typical home network and promote responsible cybersecurity practices without launching active attacks or exploiting systems.

## üß≠ Project Scope

This audit focuses on:
- Detecting connected devices on the network
- Identifying open ports and exposed services
- Reviewing router security settings (e.g., encryption, firmware, credentials)
- Examining DNS behavior and potential misconfigurations
- Capturing and analyzing unencrypted packet data responsibly

---

## üîç Key Audit Steps

1. **Enumerate Devices on the Network**
   - Use `nmap` to scan your local IP range and list all connected devices.
   ```bash
   nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
2. Scan for Open Ports and Running Services

Identify which ports are open on your router or another device.

nmap -sV 192.168.0.1

3. Check Network Connections on Your Machine

Use netstat or ss to review all open connections.

netstat -tulnp

4. Inspect DNS and IP Configuration

Look up IP and DNS info to verify if anything seems misconfigured or suspicious.

whois example.com
dig example.com
traceroute example.com
arp -a
5. Review Your Router Settings (Manually via Dashboard)

Login to your router (typically http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1) and check for:

Default login credentials (change them!)

Weak or outdated encryption (use WPA2/WPA3)

UPnP enabled (disable if not needed)

Outdated firmware (update if available)

6. Analyze Traffic (Optional ‚Äì for learning only)

Open Wireshark and capture some packets from your Wi-Fi interface.

Filter by protocols like HTTP, DNS, or ARP to analyze patterns.

Do not capture other people‚Äôs private data ‚Äî stay ethical.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
nmap ‚Äì for network and port scanning

netstat / ss ‚Äì for viewing local open connections

whois, dig, traceroute, arp ‚Äì for DNS and IP diagnostics

Router Web UI ‚Äì for config inspection

Wireshark ‚Äì for optional, ethical packet analysis
