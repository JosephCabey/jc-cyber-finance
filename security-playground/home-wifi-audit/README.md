# üõ°Ô∏è Home Wi-Fi Security Audit

This project simulates a basic home Wi-Fi network security audit using open-source tools and cybersecurity analyst methodology. The goal is to identify common vulnerabilities, assess the overall hygiene of the network, and demonstrate responsible analysis techniques ‚Äî without engaging in any intrusive or malicious activity.

## üîç Key Focus Areas

- Enumeration of connected devices using `nmap`
- Port scanning and service fingerprinting
- Router configuration review (WPA2/3 usage, default credentials, UPnP exposure)
- DNS and IP address inspection using `whois`, `dig`, and `traceroute`
- Basic packet capture and interpretation using Wireshark
- Open connection checks using `netstat` or `ss`
