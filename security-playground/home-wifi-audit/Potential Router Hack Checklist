# 🛡️ Potential Router Hack Checklist

Use this guide if you suspect someone may have accessed your home router without your permission. Follow each step to identify suspicious activity, secure your network, and regain control.

## 🔍 Signs You May Have Been Hacked

- You **can’t log into your router** with the default or known admin credentials
- The **Wi-Fi network name or password has changed** unexpectedly
- You notice **unknown devices** connected to your network
- Internet speed has slowed down **dramatically or suddenly**
- The router admin interface **locks you out after failed login attempts**
- Settings in the Xfinity app **don’t match what you configured**

---

## 🧭 What To Do Right Away

### ✅ Step 1: Check Connected Devices
- Open the **Xfinity app**
- Go to **Connect > Devices**
- Review each connected device
- Pause or block anything unfamiliar

---

### ✅ Step 2: Change Your Wi-Fi Password
- In the Xfinity app, go to:
  - **Wi-Fi Settings**
  - Rename your network (optional)
  - Set a **strong new password**

> This will disconnect all devices, so only authorized users will reconnect.

### ✅ Step 3: Try Logging Into the Router Again
Go to `http://10.0.0.1` or `http://192.168.0.1` in a browser.

Try:
```text
Username: admin
Password: password

Other possibilities:

Username: comcast / Password: 1234

Username: admin / Password: your Wi-Fi password

Password based on serial number or MAC address from the router label

🔁 Step 4: Factory Reset the Router (if needed)
If all login attempts fail, reset the router to restore factory settings:

Locate the reset pinhole on the back

Hold a paperclip in for 15–30 seconds

Wait 3–5 minutes for full reboot

Then try:

text
Copy
Edit
Username: admin
Password: password

## 🔧 After Regaining Access — Secure Your Router

Once you're in, immediately take these steps to secure your network:

- 🔑 Change the **admin password** to something strong and unique
- 🔒 Use **WPA2** or **WPA3** encryption
- 🚫 Disable **WPS** (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
- 🧩 Optionally change the router’s IP address (e.g., from `10.0.0.1` to `10.0.0.88`)
